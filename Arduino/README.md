# Flashing the firmware

First, the smart textile PCB [board must be installed to the Arduino IDE](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-IDE-Creating-Custom-Boards/).
This is most easily done by first installing the Arduino Nano 33 BLE board.
The custom PCB uses the same microcontroller as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, so the PCB is added as a variant of the Arduino.
This is done by adding the SMART_TEXTILE_PCB folder from this repo to the variants folder in arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\mbed\x.x.x
Also, in the boards.txt file in this folder, a section for the custom PCB must be added. 
The boards.txt file in this shows an example: the second section is an adapted copy of the first, which was generated by installing the Arduino Nano BLE 33.

Once the Arduino IDE can compile sketches for the smart textile PCB, open pcb_firmware.ino and export a compiled binary.
Flashing of the PCB is done through the serial wire debug (SWD) protocol using a [JLink EDU Mini](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/).
When reflashing the [bootloader](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed/tree/master/bootloaders/nano33ble), do this at address 0x00000000.
When just flashing a new sketch using a .bin file, do this at address 0x00010000.
